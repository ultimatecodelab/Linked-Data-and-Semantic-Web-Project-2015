# Galway City Car Parking API - Arjun Kharel And James Ngondo
## How to run ? 
* Download nodejs https://nodejs.org/en/download/
* Download MongoDb https://www.mongodb.org/downloads
* Download grunt cli http://gruntjs.com/getting-started (need for running the client, angularjs)
* Once you have completed the above prerequisites copy the data folder (located on the project directory) and paste it to C:\ .   This must be done before running the server because (MongoDb) by default checks C:\data for database file...Please make sure this step is carried out properly otherwise the data will not be shown/loaded...
