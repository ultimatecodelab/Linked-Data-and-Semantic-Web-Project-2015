# Galway City Car Parking API - Arjun Kharel And James Ngondo
## Brief description of our project.

## Datasets used
------------------
The  following datasets have/will be used to crean an API: 

* Dataset 1 -Parking 
* Dataset 2 -Blue Badge 
* Dataset 3 -Parking-Meters

More datasets will be added if there need be. 
All the above mentioned datasets are available from data.gov.ie

## How to Query the API
------------------------
Angularjs will be used for front-end. User will be able to query the API either using the url's,Navigation Links 
or the GUI/Front-end.
MongoDb will be used to store the datasets. 
The data will be represented visually in the forms of graphs/pie-charts etc, as this will help the user interact with the api 
more easily.
